                    <p><strong>Knight's Ascent</strong> is our flagship simulation game, where players strive to climb a tower with 100 steps, facing the risk of collapse at each step. The goal is to reach higher steps to increase the multiplier on the initial bet, managing the risk of collapse that results in losing the round.</p>
                    <p>The game offers three modes: Basic (with free bonus opportunities), Mystic (with the Mystic Mage bonus), and Dragon (with the Dragon bonus). Bonuses allow skipping steps and avoiding collapses, but at a cost, and the Dragon bonus carries a risk of failure.</p>
                    <p>Players start at step 0 with a base bet of $1.0 and aim to climb as high as possible, up to step 100, to maximize their multiplier. At any moment, they can cash out their winnings, but if a collapse occurs before cashing out, the round is lost.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gameplay Features</strong>: 97% RTP, high volatility, immersive tower-climbing mechanics with risk management, cinematic animations, and narrative-driven bonuses. Each step advances the knight's quest, building tension with potential rewards.</p>
                    <p><strong>Story</strong>: Join Sir Eldric in a kingdom shrouded in mystery as he ascends the Tower of Destiny to claim the fabled Crown of Valor. Every step brings new trials—battles with mythical creatures, enchanted riddles, and golden opportunities—turning each session into a heroic saga.</p>
